# Key Insights

The cancellation rate  is about greater  than 50%.

Direct segments have lower rate of cancellation.

The cancellation rate  for online Travel agents/Tour Operators and online Travel  agents is greater than upto 30%.

The revenue generated during weekneds and weekdays are mostly equal but slightly differences between them.

Repeated guests do not cancel their bookings it might happen they serve best to their guests and mostly are of some special type of guests also most of the customers are not repeated guests.

From the data set we concluded that highest number of bookings are from Portugal may be hotel  is located at Portugal itself and second country is the gbr which means united kingdom which is roughly approximated below 75% of Portugal bookings.

The prices of resort hotels are much higher during the month of august.The price of the city hotels varies less and is most expensive during may and September.

When lead time exceeds about above 50, guests frequently cancelled their bookings.

City hotels has more guests throughout  the year. Resort hotels are slightly closer to city hotels in summer season when by comparing their proportions. From June to September, when costs are at their greatest, few guests stay at the Resort hotel.when  winter season comes the few visitors to both the hotels.

As I can see from data set customers from aviation segment do not seem to be staying at the resort hotels and have a relatively lower average daily rate.

# Recommendations
This clearly shows that the prices in the Resort hotel are much higher during the month of August. 

There is summer season there in Portugal at that time. The price of the city hotel varies less and is most expensive during may and September where there is spring and autumn season respectively.

Cancellation rate in the direct segment is so  low.

most people does not preferred to stay at the hotels more than one week. but it seems normally to stay in resort hotels almost 2 weeks may be this changes according to segments.
